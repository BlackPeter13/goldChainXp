whereby Elder Nodes will serve catalogued music to Fango GUI wallets using their remote XFG payment connections. Allowing for any independent artist to upload &amp; sell their own audio or music album(s) - and keep 100% of revenue earned.</span>

<ul style="margin-top: 20px;">By default, we plan to offer Para Dio+ a P2P streaming rewards radio using singles submitted by artists from album(s) being sold in DIGM marketplace. Both artist &amp; listener receive rewards in <a href="https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/asset/PARA-GCFWKV4KWYPBPQVQYLVL6N6VARBLVQS6POYEMLN7AGZB5UK4VIJX565U-1?filter=trustlines" target="_blank">PARA</a> for streaming radio airtime.</ul>
<p>Prototype will also be reserved for Desktop as we have discussed making hashpower (at minimal levels) a simple requirement for any track-specific plays/skips or possibly just to listen on the streaming platform, in general.
Diverting special purpose hashpower provided by platform listeners could open up a number of economic opportunities.
Such as any Fango blocks mined from this diverted hashpower could serve as a ‘proof of listener’ to be used to pay DIGM artists a distribution % according to number of streams/plays during each 30 day cycle in XFG or DIGM.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 33px;">Marketplace payment for albums will naturally be on-chain &amp; exclusive to XFG by using built-in (fango) public addresses for each hosting node (ie artist, service provider, or even label with roster of artists*)  ( aka Elder-node service addresses )</p>
