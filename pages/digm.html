<label style="font-family:Lato;"><span style="font-size:medium;">DIGM is a music revolution via platform (or hosting framework) integration with the Fango peer-to-peer network,
whereby Elder Nodes will serve catalogued music to Fango GUI wallets using their remote XFG payment connections. Allowing for any independent artist to upload &amp; sell their own audio or music album(s) - and keep 100% of revenue earned.</span>

<p style="margin-top: 20px;">By default, we plan to offer Para Dio+ a P2P streaming rewards radio using singles submitted by artists from album(s) available for sale in DIGM marketplace. Both artist &amp; listener receive rewards in <a href="https://stellar.expert/explorer/public/asset/PARA-GCFWKV4KWYPBPQVQYLVL6N6VARBLVQS6POYEMLN7AGZB5UK4VIJX565U-1?filter=trustlines" target="_blank">PARA</a> for streaming radio airtime.</p>

<p>Prototype will be reserved for Desktop as we have discussed making hashpower (at minimal levels) a simple requirement for any track-specific plays/skips or possibly just to listen on the streaming platform, in general.
Diverting special purpose hashpower provided by platform listeners would open up a number of economic possibilities.
Such as any Fango blocks mined from this diverted hashpower could serve as a ‘proof of listener’ to be used to pay DIGM artists a distribution % according to number of streams/plays during each 30 day cycle in XFG or <a href="https://simpleledger.info/token/8261c44c396fb1120b699b10de708f37a72f8b0339752d4dba67e193dbf898eb">DIGM</a>.</p>
<p style="margin-top: 33px;">Marketplace payment for albums will naturally be on-chain &amp; exclusive to XFG by using built-in (fango) public addresses for each hosting node (artist, service provider, or even label with roster of artists*)  ( aka Elder-node service addresses )</p>

<p>DIGM & PARA tokens are both offered for the initial purpose of crowdfunding the development of ParaDio+ and DIGM Audio Marketplace, while as the platform becomes operational, DIGM tokens will be used for provider access to host/share/sell audio in the marketplace. Para will be used only for additional rewards.
By having <b>100,000 DIGM</b> as a maximum, there will always be a limited number of artists selling music on the platform at any given time thru fixed supply. PARA tokens are limited to one (1) token per platform (1 of 2 available) and are denominated sub-decimal in pico-PARA (10^12) or just "para". </p>
<sup style="font-family:Roboto;">(*) DIGM hosting Elder Nodes would serve as an artist pool
(think mix between record label and mining pool) being able to host content for, and distribute streaming royalties to, a roster of different artists. </sup>
